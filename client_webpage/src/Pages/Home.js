            They are not too choosy about where this temporary spot will be, it can be
            anywhere that they can form a cluster to protect their queen. If the honey bees seem 
            to have made a permanent home already, such as in a tree or inside a structure (wall, roof, etc) 
            they are an established colony. Removing an established colony is a Trap Out (TO) or Cut Out (CO) situation."
