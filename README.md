# Bee Rescue
> Developed by team Hornet's Hive

**Description**:  Bee Rescue has two components, a mobile application and a website. The website is for people to be able to quickly report swarms of bees on their property by submiting a short form. The application is for beekeepers to be notified about swarms that are nearby so that they can collect them. This is to aid the current process the beekeepers of Sacramento have for collecting swarms by minimizing the amount of phone calls back and forth as well as ensuring that only available and nearby beekeepers are contacted.

> Bee Rescue aims to help beekeepers whithin and outside of Sacramento efficiently collect swarms of bees so those affected by bee swarms can trust their report will be taken care of quickly.
