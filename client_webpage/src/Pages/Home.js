              Bee Rescue is an application developed in partnership with the Sacramento Area Beekeepers
              Assocation (SABA) to facilitate the fast, safe, and humane removal
              of bees from occupied areas. By filling out the attached form, local beekeepers in your area will be notified
              and will contact you to make arrangements to relocate the bees to a safe area.

            text="When bees are swarming they are generally docile. They will temporarily find a suitable 
            spot to gather while they send out scout bees to find a more permanent location as a new home.
            They are not too choosy about where this temporary spot will be, it can be
            anywhere that they can form a cluster to protect their queen. If the honey bees seem 
            to have made a permanent home already, such as in a tree or inside a structure (wall, roof, etc) 
            they are an established colony. Removing an established colony is a Trap Out (TO) or Cut Out (CO) situation."
